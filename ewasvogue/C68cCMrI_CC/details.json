I really get to wear this wow I\u2019m so grateful thank you SO SO much I\u2019m IN LOVE already\u201d\n\nWe agreed to send the dress on a particular date but somehow,the creative director said no,we needed to ship the dress two days before the agreed date because she wanted Kieshell to get the dress days before her event.\n\nWe informed Kieshell and she agreed,we proceeded with the shipment.\nWe do a lot of deliveries with Dhl and in most cases these dresses get delivered before the estimated date of delivery.\n\nBut this time,it was a different story,the dress arrived in New Zealand a day after the estimated date of delivery,customs held on to the dress for 3days!!!\n\nAccording to them,packages from Africa needs to be thoroughly checked,the dress has already been checked by Germany customs before it got to New Zealand.\n\nAfter 3days with New Zealand custom,the dress was finally delivered to Kieshell.\n\nKieshell didn\u2019t get to wear the dress for the event,she was heartbroken but in all of these she never insulted me or the brand.\n\nYeah she loved her dress!!!\nAnd of course the DRESS FIT PERFECTLY!!!\nShipped to NEW ZEALAND \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff \nNO FITTINGS! NO ALTERATIONS!!!\n \nGoodnews;\nshe shared with me that she will be need the dress for a bigger event which is more special to her.\n\nQuite a sad story but maybe a BLESSING IN DISGUISE!\n(I will definitely share the testimony with you all later,God willing!)\n\nDress @ewasvogue \nEwasvogue doll @just_kiessshell \u2764\ufe0f\nFabric @asoebilounge \n#ewasvogue #tailorcataloguepage #amvca10 #prom2024 #promdesigners #missnewzealand #missauckland",
